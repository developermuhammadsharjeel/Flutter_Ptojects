Instagram Reminder App 🚫📱

A super simple Flutter app made just for fun.
Instead of endless scrolling on Instagram, when you open this app it simply says:
“Phir aa gaye Instagram per? Goals pure kr liye?” 😏

The idea is to remind you that you shouldn’t waste time on reels until your goals are achieved.
Think of it as a light-hearted productivity hack disguised as Instagram.

✨ Features
No reels, no likes, no explore page – just a savage reminder.
Funny text that motivates you (or roasts you 😅).
You can easily change the text in the code to suit your style.

🎯 Why this app?

Because sometimes we need a funny push instead of motivational speeches.
